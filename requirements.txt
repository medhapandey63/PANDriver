1) Data Processing / Input Format
---
To run the pipeline, your dataset should contain:
  UniProt ID (e.g., P38398)
  Mutation in protein notation (e.g., R175H)
  Protein sequence (FASTA or as a column)
  Structure information (AlphaFold structure or path to structure file in .pdb format)


2) Prerequisites: Feature Calculation
Before running the models, you must compute features using:
scripts/feature_calculation.py
This script calculates sequence-, structure-, and network-based features required by the pretrained models.
Feature Modules / Dependencies
The feature generation depends on the following tools/resources:
protinter (protein interaction / interface-related features)
psiCDHit (sequence clustering / homolog processing)
AACon (conservation-based features)
PSSM (position-specific scoring matrix features)
IUPred2A (disorder prediction features)
pLDDT (structure confidence features, e.g., AlphaFold)
biographs (graph/network-based structural features)
Note: Some tools require separate installation and/or external databases (e.g., BLAST databases for PSSM). See below.
